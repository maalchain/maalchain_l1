Maalchain is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. 
It's built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) which runs on top of [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) consensus engine.
Ethereum compatibility allows developers to build applications on Maalchain using the existing Ethereum codebase and toolset,
without rewriting smart contracts that already work on Ethereum or other Ethereum-compatible networks.
Ethereum compatibility is done using modules built by [Tharsis](https://thars.is) for their [Evmos](https://evmos.org) network.

Maalchain Networkâ€™s Shariah-compliant native currency is MAAL
